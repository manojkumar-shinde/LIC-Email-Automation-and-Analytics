LIC CLAIMS – DETAILED EXPLANATION

A claim in Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) refers to a formal request made by a policyholder, nominee, or legal heir
to receive benefits payable under a life insurance policy as per its terms and conditions.

Claims are broadly classified into maturity claims and death claims.

A maturity claim arises when a policy completes its full term and remains active until the maturity date.
LIC generally sends an intimation before the maturity date informing the policyholder of the payable amount.
To receive the maturity proceeds, the policyholder must submit the original policy document,
a duly completed discharge form, valid KYC documents, and bank account details.
Once verification is completed, the maturity amount is credited to the registered bank account.

A death claim arises when the life assured passes away during the policy term.
In such cases, the nominee or legal heir must inform the LIC servicing branch and submit
the prescribed claim form, death certificate, original policy bond, and proof of entitlement.
If the policy has been in force for more than three years, the claim is usually settled after routine verification.
Deaths occurring within the first three years may require additional scrutiny.
