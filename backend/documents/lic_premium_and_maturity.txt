LIC PREMIUM PAYMENT AND MATURITY AMOUNTS

Premium payment is the process through which a policyholder keeps an LIC policy active.
Premiums can be paid through online portals, banks, digital channels, or LIC branch cash counters.

Timely payment of premiums is essential to avoid policy lapse.
Each policy includes a grace period during which payment can be made without penalty.
Failure to pay premiums within the grace period may result in policy lapse,
which suspends risk cover until revival.

A lapsed policy can usually be revived within a specified time by paying overdue premiums
along with applicable charges.

The maturity amount is the sum payable at the end of the policy term.
It generally includes the basic sum assured along with bonuses, depending on the policy.
Maturity proceeds are paid only if the policy is in force on the maturity date.
