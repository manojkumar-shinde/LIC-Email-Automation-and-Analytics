LIC POLICY STATUS AND CUSTOMER PORTAL

LIC provides an online customer portal for policyholders to access policy-related information.
To register, users must provide policy number, date of birth, premium details, mobile number, and email address.

Once registered, policyholders can view policy status, premium payment history,
maturity details, bonus information, loan eligibility, and claim status.
The portal also allows downloading premium receipts, updating contact details,
registering nominees, and tracking service requests.

Online access improves transparency and reduces the need for branch visits.
