POLICY SERVICING VS CLAIMS

Policy servicing refers to non-claim related requests made after policy issuance.
These include changes to address, phone number, email ID, nominee details,
bank account updates, and revival of lapsed policies.

Claims involve a formal request for payment under the policy terms
and require verification and settlement procedures.

Policy servicing requests are generally simpler and are handled separately
from claim-related activities.
